    <p>My name is Christine and I'm currently working on transitioning my career to be a software developer! As hard as it may be and as much as I know I'm going to struggle, the challenge is what keeps me going. It just means I'm growing! Learning to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. I love sushi, petting all the dogs I possibly can and plants!</p>
